  Problem: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
  Student Solution: I started by calculating clips in May which is 48/2 = 24. Then I sum this up, so she sold 48+24 = 72 clips in April and May together.
